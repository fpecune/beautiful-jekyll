### InMind

In 2014, Yahoo! and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have announced a five-year, $10 million partnership, called the InMind project. The goal of InMind is to invent, implement, experiment, and iterate with an intelligent assistant for mobile devices. Major companies are already exploring intelligent assistants such as Siri, and Google Now, M, and Cortana, and we expect they will continue to develop these. To make an impact as a university, our goal is not to compete with incremental extensions these systems will make over the next year or two, but instead to use InMind as a research prototype to invent intelligent assistant capabilities that may become widespread in a 5-15 year horizon – the intelligent assistants of 2025. <br/>

As a part of the InMind, our team focuses on creating an autonomous virtual personal assistant that will build long lasting relationships with people through managing rapport between them and itself. The biggest challenge of this project is to develop personal assistants at “real scale”. Built on top of the Multi-User Framework [Romero et al. 2018] , news and movie recommendation personal assistants have been deployed on Android phones. <br/>

### SARA

In this era of fears that Artificial Intelligence will destroy humanity, SARA is a Socially-Aware Robot Assistant that interacts with people in a whole new way, personalizing the interaction and improving task performance by relying on information about the relationship between the human user and virtual assistant. Rather than taking the place of people, Sara is programmed to collaborate with her human users. Rather than ignoring the socio-emotional bonds that form the fabric of society, Sara depends on those bonds to improve her collaboration skills. <br/>

Specifically, Sara is always attending to two kinds of goals at the same time: a task goal (such as finding information for her human, helping her human to navigate a conference, or helping her human user to learn a new subject matter (such as linear algebra), and a social goal (ensuring that her interaction style is comfortable, engaging, and results in increased closeness and a better working relationship between human and agent over time). <br/>

Sara accomplishes this innovative approach to robot (or virtual agent) assistance using cutting edge socially-aware artificial intelligence, developed in the ArticuLab at Carnegie Mellon University  Specifically, Sara is capable of detecting social behaviors in conversation, reasoning about how to respond to the intentions behind those particular behaviors, and generating appropriate social responses – as well as carrying out her task duties at the same time. <br/>

SARA was presented at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos (January 17-20, 2017), and World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of New Champions, in Tianjin, China (June 26-28, 2016). <br/>
