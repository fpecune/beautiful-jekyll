 Welcome to my personal website! <br/>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Language Technologies Institue at Carnegie Mellon University, working 
in the Articulab in the lab of Justine Cassell. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in the Greta Team of LTCI laboratory 
in Telecom Paristech. My thesis was conducted under the supervision of Catherine Pelachaud and Magalie Ochs. <br/>

I'm involved in the French ANR project MoCA which aims to create a little world of artificial companions assisting home 
alone children. I focus my work on building a decision-making model for artificial companions in different social contexts. <br/>

My research interests are: <br/>

- Designing virtual agents able to build and maintain long-term relationships with users
- Modeling the dynamics of virtual agent's mental and affective states
- Adapting virtual agents' behaviors to users using cognitive strategies and reactive mimetic
