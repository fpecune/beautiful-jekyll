 Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Language Technologies Institue at Carnegie Mellon University, working in the Articulab in the lab of Justine Cassell. Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. in the Greta Team of LTCI laboratory in Telecom Paristech. My thesis was conducted under the supervision of Catherine Pelachaud and Magalie Ochs.

I'm involved in the French ANR project MoCA which aims to create a little world of artificial companions assisting home alone children. I focus my work on building a decision-making model for artificial companions in different social contexts.

    My research interests are:

    Designing virtual agents able to build and maintain long-term relationships with users
    Modeling the dynamics of virtual agent's mental and affective states
    Adapting virtual agents' behaviors to users using cognitive strategies and reactive mimetic
